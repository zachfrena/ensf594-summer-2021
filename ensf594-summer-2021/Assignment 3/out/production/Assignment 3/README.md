# ENSF 594 Assignment 3: Linked Lists
**Author: Zach Frena**

This program has 5 java class files, and 1 input file. A single output file is created after running the program.
- `AnagramApp.java`: The main java class the user runs to arrange the list of words into anagrams.
- `node.java`: A class that generates a generic node for a linked list. 
- `SinglyLinkedList.java`: A class that creates a singly linked list.
- `WriteOutputFile.java`: A class that creates and writes the list of anagrams to a text file. 
- `input.txt`: The input text file that contains a collection of words that will generate the list of anagrams.
- `output.txt`: The output file that contains the list of anagrams after a successful program execution.
- `ReadInputFile.java`: A class that reads in string data from an input file.

**How to Run**:

Ensure all files are downloaded and exist in the same directory. The `input.txt` file should also 
be located in the same directory as the java files. The `AnagramApp.java` will perform all of the processing, 
there is no need for the user to interact with a command-line-interface or GUI.
After the program runs successfully, an `output.txt` file will be created and can be found in the current working 
directory.
