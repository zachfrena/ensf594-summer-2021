# ENSF 594 Assignment 5: Binary Search Tree
**Author: Zach Frena**

This program has 4 java class files, a JPG image file, and 1 input file. After running the program, two (2) output files are created.
- `Tree.java`: A class that generates a binary search tree (BST). The constructor creates an empty tree, and values can be inserted using designated methods.
- `Node.java`: A class that generates a generic node containing the student information.
- `Queue.java`: A class that creates a queue data structure.
- `TreeApp.java`: The main app of the program that reads the input file, creates the BST, and then writes to the 2 output files.
- `input1.txt`: The input text file that contains a collection of student data that will be inserted into the BST.
- `output1.txt`: The output file that contains the list of student data printed out from the BST using a depth-first, in-order traversal.
- `output2.txt`: The output file that contains the list of student data printed out from the BST using a breadth-first, level-order traversal.
- `BST.JPG`: A picture of the binary search tree containing the student data that was used to order the tree (i.e. names)

**How to Run**:

Ensure all files are downloaded and exist in the same directory. The `input1.txt` file should also
be located in the same directory as the java files. The `TreeApp.java` will perform all of the processing,
there is no need for the user to interact with a command-line-interface or GUI.
After the program runs successfully, 2 files will be created: an `output1.txt` file and an `output2.txt`, both of which will be found in the current working
directory.
